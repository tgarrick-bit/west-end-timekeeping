# West End Workforce Platform - Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. Employee Data Import System
- **Location**: `/admin/employees/import`
- **Features**:
  - Excel/CSV file upload with drag & drop
  - Data preview before import
  - West End Workers Excel format support (row 7 headers, row 8+ data)
  - Automatic department mapping from customer paths
  - Job title auto-assignment based on department
  - Time approver mapping (manager-demo, manager2-demo, manager3-demo)
  - Validation for required fields (name, email, department, job title, hourly rate)
  - Import results with success/failure counts
  - Downloadable template with sample data
  - Error handling and user feedback

### 2. Fixed Admin Dashboard Issues
- **Header Consistency**: Removed duplicate headers, now matches manager dashboard exactly
- **Logo Implementation**: WE logo properly displayed across all pages
- **Card Layout**: Admin dashboard now uses consistent card grid layout matching employee dashboard
- **Styling**: All cards have uniform height, spacing, and visual hierarchy

### 3. Fixed Manager Dashboard Button Functionality
- **Pending Timesheets**: Routes to `/manager/timesheets` ✅
- **Pending Expenses**: Routes to `/manager/expenses` ✅  
- **Total Amount**: Routes to `/manager/financial` ✅
- **Your Team**: Routes to `/manager/contractors` ✅

### 4. Fixed Routing Structure
- **Homepage**: `localhost:3000` → Login page (redirects from `/`)
- **Dashboard**: `localhost:3000/dashboard` → Homepage with features (requires login)
- **Manager**: `localhost:3000/manager` → Manager dashboard
- **Employee**: `localhost:3000/employee` → Employee portal
- **Admin**: `localhost:3000/admin` → Admin dashboard

### 5. Authentication & Navigation
- **Dashboard Protection**: `/dashboard` route now requires authentication
- **Navigation Links**: Added dashboard link to TopNavigation component
- **Role-based Routing**: Login redirects users to appropriate dashboards
- **Logo Consistency**: WE logo appears on all pages including login

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Excel Import System
- **Dependencies**: `xlsx` package (already installed)
- **File Support**: `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`
- **Data Mapping**: 
  - First Name → firstName
  - Last Name → lastName
  - Primary Email → email
  - Home Phone → phone
  - Default Customer Full Path → department (auto-extracted)
  - Employee Status → status
  - Date Started → startDate
  - Work Location → workLocation
  - Address fields → formatted address

### Department Mapping Logic
```typescript
const extractDepartment = (customerPath: string): string => {
  if (customerPath.includes('Department of Health')) return 'Health Services';
  if (customerPath.includes('Department of Commerce')) return 'Commerce';
  if (customerPath.includes('Chickasaw Nation')) return 'Chickasaw Nation';
  return 'General';
};
```

### Time Approver Mapping
```typescript
const mapTimeApprover = (department: string): string => {
  const approverMap: { [key: string]: string } = {
    'Health Services': 'manager-demo',      // Jane Doe
    'Commerce': 'manager2-demo',            // Tom Wilson  
    'Chickasaw Nation': 'manager3-demo',    // Lisa Chen
    'General': 'manager-demo'               // Default to Jane Doe
  };
  return approverMap[department] || 'manager-demo';
};
```
