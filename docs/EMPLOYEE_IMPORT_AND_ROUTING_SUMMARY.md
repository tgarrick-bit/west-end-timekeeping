# Employee Import System and Routing Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Employee Import System (`/admin/employees/import`)

The employee import system is **fully implemented** and ready to use:

- **Location**: `src/app/admin/employees/import/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Excel/CSV file upload with drag & drop
  - Data preview before import
  - Automatic column mapping for West End Workers Excel format
  - Validation of required fields
  - Duplicate employee detection
  - Import results with success/failure counts
  - Downloadable template with correct format

- **Excel Format Support**:
  - Headers start at row 7 (as per West End Workers format)
  - Data starts from row 8 onwards
  - Supports columns: Employee Id, First Name, Last Name, Email, Department, etc.
  - Automatic department mapping and job title assignment
  - Time approver assignment based on department

- **Dependencies**: XLSX package is already installed and working

### 2. Routing Structure Changes

The routing has been restructured as requested:

#### **Before (Old Structure)**:
- `localhost:3000` → Homepage with features
- `localhost:3000/dashboard` → Employee dashboard
- `localhost:3000/login` → Login page

#### **After (New Structure)**:
- `localhost:3000` → **Redirects to `/login`**
- `localhost:3000/login` → **Login page (landing page)**
- `localhost:3000/dashboard` → **Homepage with features (Manager/Employee cards)**
- `localhost:3000/manager` → Manager dashboard
- `localhost:3000/employee` → **New employee portal**
- `localhost:3000/admin` → Admin dashboard

### 3. New Employee Portal (`/employee`)

Created a dedicated employee portal page:
- **Location**: `src/app/employee/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Employee-specific dashboard
  - Timesheet management
  - Expense submission
  - Profile management
  - Recent activity tracking

### 4. Updated Login Redirects

Login now correctly routes users based on role:
- **Admin** → `/admin`
- **Manager** → `/manager`  
- **Employee** → `/employee` (was `/dashboard`)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### File Changes Made:

1. **`src/app/page.tsx`** → Now redirects to `/login`
2. **`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`** → Contains homepage with feature cards
3. **`src/app/employee/page.tsx`** → New employee portal (created)
4. **`src/app/login/page.tsx`** → Updated redirect logic for employees

### Import System Features:

- **Column Mapping**: Automatically maps Excel columns to employee fields
- **Data Validation**: Checks required fields (name, email, department, etc.)
- **Department Extraction**: Parses customer path to determine department
- **Job Title Assignment**: Auto-assigns job titles based on department
- **Time Approver Mapping**: Assigns appropriate managers based on department
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting with row numbers
- **Preview Mode**: Shows first 5 rows before import

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Admins:

1. Navigate to `/admin/employees`
2. Click the "Import Employees" card (green)
3. Upload Excel file or download template
4. Preview data and click "Import X Employees"
5. Review results and view imported employees

### For Users:

1. **Landing Page**: `localhost:3000` → automatically redirects to login
2. **Login**: Use demo credentials:
   - Employee: `employee@westendworkforce.com` / `employee123`
   - Manager: `manager@westendworkforce.com` / `manager123`
   - Admin: `admin@westendworkforce.com` / `admin123`
3. **Navigation**: After login, users are automatically routed to their appropriate dashboard

## 📊 Expected Excel Format

The system expects Excel files with this structure:

```
Row 1-6: Empty or header information
Row 7: Column headers
Row 8+: Employee data
```

**Required Columns**:
- Employee Id
- First Name  
- Last Name
- Primary Email
- Employee Status
- Date Started
- Default Customer Full Path
- Home Phone
- Work Location
- Address 1
- City
- Home State
- Postal/Zip Code

## ✅ Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Upload Excel/CSV files with employee data
- ✅ Preview data before importing  
- ✅ Validate required fields
- ✅ Map manager names to time approvers
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Show import results with success/failure counts
- ✅ Download template for proper formatting
- ✅ Prevent duplicate employees (by email)
- ✅ Login page is now the landing page
- ✅ Proper role-based routing after login
- ✅ Employee portal accessible at `/employee`
- ✅ Homepage features accessible at `/dashboard`

## 🔍 Testing

The system has been tested and builds successfully:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ All routes are properly generated
- ✅ No missing dependencies
- ✅ Import system is fully functional

## 📝 Notes

- **No styling or layout changes** were made - only routing and file locations
- **All existing functionality** is preserved
- **XLSX package** is already installed and working
- **Demo accounts** are available for testing all user roles
- **Import system** handles the specific West End Workers Excel format correctly

The employee import system is production-ready and the routing structure has been successfully updated as requested.
